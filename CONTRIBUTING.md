## Contributing.

Hey there, thank you for taking interest in this project. I'd list the steps you can follow to get started in contributing.

- First, you have to fork this repository. When you do that, you're creating a copy of this repository under your own github account.
- Clone the repository (your own forked version), by doing this...

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kaf-lamed-beyt/next-status-modal.git
```

- Set the remote upstream of your forked repository to the base respository (i.e. the original repository)

```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/kaf-lamed-beyt/next-status-modal.git
```

- Create a branch and start working your feature.

```bash
    git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

- Save and commit your changes

```bash
    git add --all

    git commit -m "your message"
```

- Push to your branch, create a pull request and wait for it to be merged.

```bash
    git push origin [branch name]
```

## Happy Hacking!
